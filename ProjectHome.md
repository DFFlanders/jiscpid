# What is this website and who is it for? #
This website is an overview of the JISC projects currently taking place in the jiscPID programme.  "jiscPID" represents two things: (1) the ["Joint Information Systems Committee" (JISC)](http://www.jisc.ac.uk) which is the funding organisation behind this set of projects, and (2) the Persistent IDentifiers (PIDs).  Please see the sidebar links for the history and context for these set of projects.

_DISCLAIMER: This site is not an official JISC site but rather the wiki-notebook for the jiscPID Programme Manager to keep track of the various projects taking place within this programme._

# jiscPID projects: "improving the extent to which identifiers for public .ac.uk websites are planned and managed within institutions" #

The jiscPID projects were funded in February 2011 (they will run six months, til July 2011).  These project represent...

All jiscPID projects are required to achieve the following objectives during the course of their funding:

  1. To engage throughout the project with an appropriate range of stakeholder groups within the institution, to build consensus on a structure for the institutional web site (or part thereof) that can reasonably be expected to persist and that effectively supports content creation
  1. To describe this structure as a data model
  1. To produce a representation of the proposed web site structure that can be used as a basis for communication and liaison with non-technical stakeholders, including cross-institution management, and support the ongoing engagement above
  1. To produce an exemplar prototype (re-)organisation of the public-facing web pages (or a subset of pages) according to the structured data model with the following explicitly demonstrated in the prototype: a.) overall structure of the website explicit in the URL syntax, with a justification for the persistence of those URLs, b.) data at those URLs in a form that can be easily reused by third parties (e.g. CSV, RSS, JSON, RDFa, RDF), and c.) indicative examples for how third parties could reuse the structure of the public-facing web pages and the data at each of those URLs.
  1. To undertake a comparison/contrast between how two or more HE/FE organisations have organised their public facing ac.uk web pages as compared to their own.  The comparison should include: a.) use case examples for why the structures are different, b.) exemplar scenarios suggested for how third parties might reuse the content of both organisations despite their divergence in structure.

**Projects will do their uptmost to engage the wider UK higher education community so that the work will enable other institutions to take advantage of the outputs and experiences.**

The projects funded represent a balanced portfolio of work.  Total spending on these projects by the JISC was Â£70K.  To explore these projects please use the following browse and search options below:

# FAQ #
THIS IS A DRAFT MORE COMING SOON

  * Q: What is a persistent Identifier?
    * A: Our friends at the Australian National Data Service have done a good job of identifying what a "PID" is for novice users: http://ands.org.au/guides/persistent-identifiers-awareness.html
    * A: Also worth citing is a glossary of terms related to persistent identifiers:

These set of questions help define how the jiscPID collection of projects (funded under the #INF11 Programme of work) are defined and more widely disseminated).

  * Q1. How are the jiscPID projects (as a collective) changing the sector?
    * A:
  * Q2. If the jiscPID projects are going to change the sector, how will we notice when change occurs?
    * A:

  * Q3. Who will read the things produced by jiscPID projects and help explain them to the powers that be?
    * A:

  * Q4. Who are the most significant stakeholders (audiences) who will be affected by the change that comes out of the jiscPID projects as a collective?
    * A:

  * Q5. How will JISC gather information from the projects to help promote them and advertise them to the wider world?
    * A:
