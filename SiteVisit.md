# Why visit each project face-to-face? #

From the Programme Manager's point of view the site visit is the most significant time spent with projects as it gives a chance to find out what each individual project is excited and passionate about.  Why care about excitement and passion? - Because, these are the things that drive change and innovation (well that and a really good user-centric idea).

**_In short, the goal of this meeting is to find out what cool thing you are creating, and then to focus on on how we optimise that thing into a product so we can get other Universities to reuse it._**

## Setting up the site visit ##

Prior to the SiteVisit the project should have completed their "Project Plan Posts", "DoaP d/b entry" and at 2 or 3 "Project Progress Posts", see ProjectDocumentationInstructions.

### Preparation for a good site visit: ###
The site visit will be an open agenda meeting intended to explore two things:

  * I.) Intangible Products: The "soft" products of the project are things like skills, relationships, observed patterns, failures, etc.  Your programme manager will want these documented in the project blog so best you get these things down as you go.
  * II.) Tangible Product: what is the thing you are creating that people will want to reuse.  While many projects will have several deliverables including things such as software, reports and policies to show for their hard work, it is essential that JISC narrows down to what the primary product is going to be from the project.  This is so we can help support you in telling the rest of the world about product.

## What to expect ##
  * This meeting should be an extended conversation, you can expect your programme manager to have read over your project posts and to have checked your DoaP.
  * The site visit will be a 2-3 hour meeting (preferably before or after lunch), please keep it informal so as many one-to-one/two conversations can occur.  Please NO presentations unless being used for reference during the conversation: diagrams, pictures and whiteboard welcome.
  * All of the project team members should attend at some point (not everyone has to be there at the same time, but the Programme Manager has come all that way to see the entire project team face-to-face so please do schedule time with all team members accordingly), a tour around campus is nice as well to help contextualise the project team.
    * Please make sure to send directions on how to get to your building well in advance of the site visit (as with all good public sector staff your Programme Manager will be coming via public transport, i.e. train).
  * This is your one and only visit with your programme manager so do take advantage of this meeting, e.g. Programme Manager's are often the most well informed cross-sector person who can make additional resources available for your project.
  * This meeting is about you and your project so you should do most of the talking; ideally your Programme Manager should be asking questions and taking notes while you provide as much insight as possible.  Please Note: All of this data will help inform the JISC on future spending initiatives.

### Post site visit ###
After the site visit the Programme Manager has quite a few tasks they will follow-up on:
  * The Programme Manager will type up recommendations and pass them back to the project for approval prior to posting on this website.
  * The team should declare which recommendations they will take on as actions (if any), N.B. the project team is not obligated to follow up on the JISC Programme Manger's recommendations.
  * The actions (from the recommendations), project blog and DoaP will be given to the "Programme Evidence Gatherer" who will write up a newsletter telling all the projects of the good things you are doing (along with links back to your project blog).

_And don't forget this is a good opportunity to take a team picture!_    For example, the SiteVisit with the jiscOpenBib and jiscOpenCite Project in Cambridge:
