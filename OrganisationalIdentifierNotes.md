## History of this group and how it was formed ##
  * Amsterdam meeting > Repository Identifiers > Persistent Identifiers > What could be done that would be useful and complement activity that is already going on > Looked at identifiers for people, objects and repositories (but not originally organisations) > NJ and AT wanted to move things forward > Wolfram suggested work to take place on organisational identifiers > NJ/AT agreed to do scoping study > MD via UKOLN to write scoping study for what could be done > WHY: need to figure out what can be done re organisation identifiers and what would be the value?

# Aim/Objectives of Group #
  * To do something **pragmatic** in terms of demonstrating value of organisational identifiers and their use.

## Potential Outcomes ##
  * A demonstrator showing the value of organisation identifiers to end users (researchers)
    * .: Researchers continue to use their org's homepage (.ac .edu) as an identifier at the top of their research papers; that home page then then provides further value by providing machine readable context for the organisations relationships and existence across the distributed Web.
  * A visionary prototype that inspires stakeholders as to what could be achieved if organisations managed their identifiers.
    * .: Funding organisation build in mandatory policies making organisational management of identifiers required.
    * .: Name identifier groups (Orcid?) recognise the value of having a distributed identifier registry.

## Scoping and hypothesis testing work ##

Video Conference Call to Demonstrate outputs on 16 November 2010 at 10am GMT
  * Phase 1: identify the legal entities in terms of organisational identifiers
    * **Output**: RDFa snippet to embed on top level home page of organisation, i.e. predicates for declaring other identifiers across the web that identify the institution (sameAs?), e.g. university Fb, YouTube, iTunes identifiers, identifiers from other national organisations, other spellings and human identifiers for the organisation, and other **equivalent** identifiers for organisation.
    * **Output**: List of pain points for requesting that the RDFa snippet is embedded into the home page of the organisation, recommendation for policy practices to put in place if other institutions want to

Video Conference Call to Demonstrate Outputs on NN MONTH 2010
  * Phase 2: identify the virtual organisations across and within the institution (hasRelation, hasChildOrganisation <- these are not the right predicates.
    * **Output**: RDFa snippet to embed in top level home page of organisation, i.e. predicated for declaring child departments/organisation within the institution, i.e. University of Y hasDepartment X at this URI (implications for department home page having identifiers for authors at their home page).
    * **Output**: List of pain points for listing child organisations
    * **Output**: RDFa snippet to embed in top level home page of organisation, i.e. predicates for declaring virtual organisations that span accross multiple organisations
    * **Output**: List of pain points for embedding and representing these multiple organisation identifiers in the home page of university websites.

## Problem Space / Use Cases (Please Add to Below in Comments) ##
  * Relationship between organisations, e.g. relationship of a research department with an organisation
  * Research Assessment
  * Research helping in multiple places: institution being able to say this person contributed stuff from this institution in another world.
  * Virtual organisations (ANDS, JISC) that sit across multiple physical organisations
