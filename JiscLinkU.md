# Call for Applications of the Linking You Toolkit #

## Background and rationale ##

1.	JISC’s vision is one of easy and widespread access to content, anytime, anywhere; a vision with technology and information management at the heart of research and education. The work under this strand of the call supports the implementation of this vision by enabling institutions better to exploit their web presence, enabling information to be more easily discovered.

2.	The JISC strategic aims include developing and providing innovative and sustainable ICT infrastructure, services and practice that support institutions in meeting their mission to provide high-quality, cost-effective teaching and research that meets the needs of students, the economy and society. This can be summarised as the development, provision and use of a digital infrastructure for education and research, which comprises interoperable institutional, collective, national and international elements.

3.	Projects funded under this call will be part of the Digital Infrastructure Portfolio (#jiscDI) and organised as part of the Digital Infrastructure Directions Programme (#jiscDID). It will be important for projects to build on previous relevant work funded as part of this programme and other programmes and services (please see the [Digital Infrastructure team blog](http://infteam.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2011/10/10/the-digital-infrastructure-team-and-blog/) for further examples).

4.	This Call requests proposals that will implement and build on the ‘Linking You Toolkit’ available at http://lncn.eu/toolkit.  Please see the ‘glossary’ below for further explanation of the Toolkit.

### Why should institutions want to implement the Linking You Toolkit ###

5.	Why might Universities need a ‘Linking You Toolkit”?  Since JISC's report on Content Management Systems c.2005. JISC has been aware of the increasing issue that almost all University Web Managers face with regards to the rate by which their websites are growing organically.  This growth of pages within .ac.uk public facing website continues in complexity and size, especially as departments change, new managerial policies are adopted and as editorial control is devolved (not to mention the increasing number of Universities systems that make up their .ac.uk domain). Additional pressure also comes from government and their requirements to make data more open and accessible.

6.	Regardless of how Universities have grown their websites and organised them, they must organise themselves and the content they produce so it is easily discovered and optimised for use by a diverse range of users.  University websites must meet the needs of their regular members and frequent users as well as visitors (e.g. potential students, the media, employers, researchers, etc). In addition the website must be clearly organised for search engine spiders so they can easily crawl and make data findable in the first place.

7.	The ‘Linking You Toolkit’ encourages the .ac.uk sector to join together in adopting shared conventions that will:

  * a.	Enable better IT systems integration
  * b.	Make the structure of the website more logical and human readable to internal staff, thereby enabling more long term URI addressing between online services in the institution.
  * c.	Encourage consideration for appropriate technology platforms, i.e. mobile and desktop rendering of the website.
  * d.	Future proof against non-sustainable URI management practices.
  * e.	Encourage greater reuse of data, by establishing an IT ethos of “designing with data”.
  * f.	Improve discoverability of resources (and SEO).

8.	For [further more specific examples please see this post on a list of benefits the ‘Linking You’ toolkit](http://infteam.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2011/08/24/linking-you-toolkit-projects/) could achieve for the sector.  The [‘Linking You Toolkit’ has a project blog](http://linkingyou.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/) which provides the reasoning behind the above reasons.

### Glossary ###

9.	 Many of the terms used in this call can have multiple meanings, the following definitions are therefore provided to help give clarity, however the JISC Programme Manager should be contacted if any questions arise.  Please note all words in ALL CAPS are “tags”, “labels” and/or project acronyms which should reveal their further meaning by searching for them on the Web.  Though a brief description for several of them is given below.

  * a.	Data aggregation: One of the advantages of several .ac.uk websites adopting the toolkit is that it will be easy to discover data for several websites by using a shared URL syntax or ‘Vocabulary URI’ (see term below).  For example the URL of `http://foo.ac.uk/news` would mostly likely contain an RSS feed which if several institutions adopted this convention, it would enable a ‘University news App’ to be created where all University news could be fed into for a wider readership.
  * b.	HTTP Redirect (301, 303): These are the HTTP codes recommended for redirecting a website; see ‘URL Syntax’ below.  Projects that are funded will receive guidance and support for implementing these redirects from the LNCNEU support project. For a definitive reference please see the IETF RFC2616 protocol.
  * c.	JISCLINKU   is the label that will be used to refer to the community of projects and institutions who are implementing the “Linking You Toolkit”.  These projects that are funded by JISC will actively participate with the community support and coordination project called LNCNEU (see term below).  The LNCNEU project will provide support in how the toolkit can be implemented as well as help facilitate community collaboration (e.g. a listserv to talk about issues with the toolkit as well as a community event to bring the project together and recruit more institutions to the community).
  * d.	Linking You Toolkit (aka ‘the Toolkit’): This is the toolkit which includes the ‘URL Syntax’ as well as advice and guidance for how ‘the Linking You’ Toolkit should be implemented by projects funded as a JISCLINKU project institution, see: http://lncn.eu/toolkit and its subsequent pages.  To note: the toolkit will be further developed based on the work of the projects in this community.  Therefore the toolkit is currently in a ‘beta’ state and will be improved and launched for wider use by other .ac.uk domains based on further improvements by the community of projects that will be funded.
  * e.	LNCNEU  is the label used to refer to the community support project that will work with each project to help implement the Toolkit.  In short the LNCNEU project will lead the JISCLINKU community of projects that will be funded as part of this Call.
  * f.	SEO (Search Engine Optimisation): The ‘Linking You Toolkit’ is not intended as an individual consultancy solution for increasing search engine results, rather it is intended as an agreement between Universities to present certain pages using shared conventions which will encourage discovery and therefore have the potential to boost SEO.  That said, the community of projects funded through this work will be asked to demonstrate what search engine optimisation is being monitored via an analytics tools to see what results it does have on SEO.
  * g.	URL Syntax: Currently the ‘Linking You Toolkit’ suggests a structured convention for URLs, for example if there is a page for undergraduate courses it suggests that the syntax of “`http://foo.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses`” should be adopted.  This does not mean the original URL to the courses page needs to be changed, rather that a new URL can be minted and then redirected using HTTP 3xx to do the redirection (see below).
  * h.	Vocabulary URI (aka linked data predicates) In addition to considering the use of a shared URL syntax across .ac.uk websites, is the possibility of also using common vocabulary terms in the form of linked data URIs.  For example .ac.uk’s could use HTML5 to embed in their home page a list of agreed URIs that point to where their data exists.  This could be part of the experimental work that the JISCLINKU community will discuss, but is not currently part of the Toolkit.  Regardless of which technology is adopted, the aim of the Toolkit is to establishing agreed conventions that facilitate navigation and deployment of tools to assist discovery.

### Overview for Project Proposals ###

10.	JISC invites project proposals which are looking to participate in a community of projects whose joint effort will be in the implementation and improvement of the ‘Linking You Toolkit’ for the purpose of demonstrating the benefits it can bring to students, researchers, lecturers and other University staff.

11.	Bidders are advised to refer to the glossary (above) for definitions, terms or labels (e.g. “URL syntax”, “redirection”, “LNCNEU”, etc), and to contact the JISC Programme Manager for any questions on how an institution can participate.

12.	Projects funded under this strand of work should look to adopt and build upon the recommendations from the ['Linking You' Toolkit’](http://lncn.eu/toolkit). This will include a two stage process for each project:
  * a.	First stage: implementing the current ‘beta’ Toolkit in collaboration with a community of other institutions so as to build upon and refine the Toolkit as a more mature product (i.e. the JISCLINKU community, lead by the LNCNEU support project will facilitate this maturity process);
  * b.	Second stage: demonstrating the value that the Toolkit has brought to the institution by building a product that will demonstrate the return on investment (RoI) for the institution.

13.	The first stage will be both implementation as well as feedback via the JISCLINKU community.  To note: the Toolkit is in a ‘beta’ state and should be further improved prior to release to the wider sector, hence this first stage in which the projects will need to engage.  The second stage of “demonstrating the value of the toolkit” can be done in various ways (and will be determined by the first stage of implementing the Toolkit in collaboration with the community). It will be the responsibility of projects to demonstrate a Return on Investment, such as: SEO, more efficient organisation of institutional URLs, ease of discovering and aggregating data, new tools for visualisation, time or cost efficiencies in creating links and/or ease of use by the .ac.uk staff, students and potential students.  In short, in the first stage projects should implement and improve the Toolkit; and in the second stage, projects should build on the first stage by producing an innovative product for wider ac.uk use to demonstrate the usefulness of the Toolkit.

14.	The reference point for this strand of work is the 'Linking You Toolkit' especially [the page on guidance for the ‘Data Model’](http://lncn.eu/toolkit/model).  All projects bidding in this strand of funding must declare how they will implement these guidelines in collaboration (and with support from) the LNCNEU support project.

### Scope ###

15.	This programme area is requesting proposals from those actively involved in the editorial, marketing and maintenance of their .ac.uk website be that via a specific department within the institution or via the centrally managed IT department of an institution.  Projects should have spoken with contacts in central IT regarding technical aspects of the project (especially CMS vendors if the system is not easily customised), corporate marketing staff and the staff members responsible for overseeing the minting and creation of URLs for the University website (if such staff exist). If there are questions regarding the applicability or scope please contact the JISC Programme Manager responsible for the Call.

### Objectives ###

16.	The following objectives must be addressed by all project proposals:
  * a.	To engage throughout the project with an appropriate range of stakeholder groups within the institution to implement the “Linking You Toolkit” for the purposes of enhancing the Universities online presence.
  * b.	To engage as a member of the JISCLINKU community as lead by the LNCNEU support project, which will provide advice and guidance on implementing the Toolkit as well as encouraging discussion regarding issues, problems and innovations around the Toolkit.
  * c.	To advance the Toolkit in collaboration with LNCNEU support project which will help coordinate discussion via an online community discussion platform (e.g. listserv or other) and through community events (either virtual or face to face).
  * d.	To explore and report back on the possibilities for how the Toolkit saves the institution money or increases the overall earning potential (at a minimum projects will need to share their analytics with JISC so overall SEO value can be analysed.  JISC will not share these analytics and will destroy them upon analysis).  Projects can also contact the JISC Programme Manager for further support in what economic model might best apply for the purposes of demonstrating value.
  * e.	To maintain a project blog (that will also act as the word processing platform for project documentation) for communicating the progress of the project alongside advice for implementing the toolkit.  Projects will be responsible for a minimum of a paragraph worth of text posted per fortnight the project runs to keep the community up to date on progress (i.e. either a couple of sentences each week or a more lengthy post once a month). The JISC programme manager overseeing this work will provide guidance and editorial comment on the blog throughout the project’s duration.
  * f.	To create a clear presentation for staff within the host institution (potentially including: use cases, policy statement, guidelines, support strategies, and/or other methods) for embedding the toolkit into the work-load of core institutional staff.  This should also act as the sustainability plan for maintaining the Toolkit for a minimum of three years beyond the life of the project.
  * g.	Produce a final project ‘product’ (i.e. presentation, app, aggregation, SEO analysis, marketing statement, internal staff guidance, etc) for senior managers and applicable staff within the institution (to be shared with the wider community) demonstrating the value of having implemented the Toolkit and innovated further uses of it.  This final product will be submitted to a review panel that JISC will organise at the end of the Programme.

### Methods ###

17.	Projects are free to adopt the most appropriate methods to undertake the work.  Proposals must justify the approach to be taken with respect to how it will differ and/or bring more value to the institution as well as the sector on the whole by using the ‘Linking You Toolkit’.  The project methodology adopted should clearly take account of how it will engage with the community aspects of the work.

### Requirements ###

18.	Bidders are highly encouraged to contact the JISC Programme Manager responsible for the Call prior to bidding.  Questions on the applicability of the project to the Call as well as the process by which JISC has the community mark proposals and select successful proposals is welcome and encouraged.

19.	Proposal must demonstrate their understanding of the ‘Linking You Toolkit’ and how it can apply to their institution.  This should also include ideas for how the proposed project would engage in the JISCLINKU community to further progress the Toolkit.  Proposals should have clear understanding of the Toolkit as published at http://lncn.eu/toolkit and articulate the value of their innovation based on this toolkit.

20.	JISC funds projects in parallel to take advantage of the community aspects of having multiple Universities and Colleges collaborating in a communal conversation.  Accordingly, projects funded will be part of a group of projects labelled as ‘the “JISCLINKU” project community’.  This label will be used throughout the programme to help identify the group of projects all working on the changing the way .ac.uk identifiers are represented to assure they are easily discovered on the Web.  JISC is funding these projects as a community to help change the sector and so participating in the JISCLINKU community as well as the larger JISC community will need to be written in and budgeted as part of the project’s proposal.  Projects should budget in a minimum of five days for working with JISC to assure Grant responsibilities are met, e.g. filling out forms to be listed on JISC & HEFCE systems, meeting with your JISC Programme Meeting via a site visit, attending a Programme Meeting, etc.  The days allocated for working with JISC should not include days allocated for working with the LNCNEU support project and JISCLINKU community projects.

21.	Both the project blog and university / college website must have analytics tools installed to monitor web traffic, especially with regards to SEO.  The analytics will need to be shared with JISC (confidentially) so evidence for the value of the Toolkit can be collected and shared with the wider community.  Support will be provided for projects not familiar with the installation and use of an analytics tools in the form of an event in the first month of the project, projects should budget accordingly to attend this event if they do not have an analytics tools installed.

22.	The JISC Developer Community (#devCSI) has been set up by UKOLN as a programme support activity to provide training and community collaboration for developers; it will be important for all projects funded as part of this Programme to support the advancement of technical skills as part of the innovation they are achieving.  Consideration should be made for how the project might attend one of these training events.

23.	Proposals will need to clearly define the licenses used for all content types produced by the project (e.g. their project blog, project website, database, spreadsheet data, code, etc). Your JISC Programme Manager can provide examples of which licenses are appropriate for use with these various types of content based upon the institutional use and need, e.g. CC-Attribution for project blog, CC-Zero for Database and Spreadsheet data, GPL or Apache for code.

24.	All proposals must include provision for their project blogs to be archived with the UK Web Archive to assure the long term preservation of their work. The JISC Programme Manager will provide the ‘Description of a Project’ form to be filled out by projects to assure this happens.

### Outputs ###

25.	All projects must produce the following outputs:
  * a.	Evidence and advice to the wider HEI community (via their project blog) for how they have implemented the ‘Linking You Toolkit’.
  * b.	A project blog for informing the wider .ac.uk community outlining the experience and advancement achieved during the project.
  * c.	A  final “product post” for how they have advanced the ‘Linking You Toolkit’ so that other Higher and Further Education institutions will see the value in adopting shared conventions. NB as part of the first stage of the project, the community should also agree what parts of the Toolkit are not helpful and should be made redundant prior to publishing the Toolkit to the wider community.
  * d.	A presentation for internal stakeholders (though shared with the wider community) for how the Toolkit has been of value (or not) as well as how the Toolkit has been of value and how the benefits realised should be maintained beyond the life of the project.
  * e.	Evidence (via the project blog) for how they actively engaged in the community sharing and collaboration aspects (as lead by the LNCNEU support project).

### Partnerships ###

26.	If applicable projects are encouraged to partner with vendor or consultants who oversee the architecture of their CMS, so long as the partner writes a letter of support (to be submitted alongside the project proposal) stating how they will participate in the community aspects of the project.  The majority of funding should be spent within the sector, if this is not the case the project will need to explain their rationale (especially in terms of sustainability) for any other budget decisions.

27.	Projects should build into their workplan engagement with the LNCNEU support project as a partner whom they will utilise throughout the duration of their project.  For questions regarding the LNCNEU support project please contact the project manager, Joss Winn (e-mail: jwinn@lincoln.ac.uk).

### Further information on requirements and how they might be interpreted by markers ###

28.	Markers of the proposal will (in accordance with the standard JISC marking criteria) be familiar with the ‘Linking You Toolkit’ and its current ‘beta’ state and will consider bids that both implement the Toolkit as per instructions as well as challenge it to be further advanced and adapted for use by the wider UK HE/FE sector.

### Funding available ###

29.	A total of £140,000 is available for this work. Accordingly, about 10 projects will be funded for around £14,000 each.

### Length of projects and start and end dates ###

30.	Projects should start by February 1st 2012 and should finish and finalise deliverables by September 2012

### Further information ###

31.	Any enquiries about this section of the call should be directed to David F. Flanders, the Programme Manager responsible for this area of activity (d.flanders@jisc.ac.uk, 07891 501194, skype: david.flanders, twitter: @dfflanders)
