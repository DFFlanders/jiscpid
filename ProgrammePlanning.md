Description of the Activity & Link to JISC Strategic Objectives

Why It Is Important to Your Institution: The URI at the top of the browser is the most significant bit of information that any institutions manages as without it there is no finding the intellectual capital produced by students and staff. While identifiers might seem like nothing more than just random numbers and letters in actual fact they are in actuality the way that humans understand the Web, and as time move on and content continues to grow exponentially the ability to read and use those identifiers will be essential to the day to day institutional management of everything from student and staff identifiers to research and teaching and learning identifiers. All of which require very careful consideration so that resources are finadable and usable in the future. This work will build on the recent community consultation http://identifiers2010.jiscpress.org/5-2-5-1-types-of-entity-that-need-identifiers/ and invite projects to create case studies to describe URI patterns for various types of objects and case studies that document implementations of good practice for persistence. This activity will engage with strategic partners (W3C Technical Archtecture Group, RDF and the international DOI Foundation etc). The benefit of this work is to enable HEIs to start manage their identifier sets better, being better informed about how to do that and the risks of not doing it.”

Who the funding may be of interest to in your institution:

First and foremost the concern will come from lecturers and students as they are given identifiers for themselves which they will want to be readable and comprehensible so they can pass those identifiers off to other people. Secondary to this will be the librarians and it staff who will need to add identifiers to the content that is created by students and staff. Following on from that will be the Pro vice chancellors as their websites and primary advertising portals will require easily findable URLs so they can gain more business. In short, identifiers are an institution wide concern that literally decides the obscurity or popularity of everything an institution produces. Accordingly projects will require a collection of these users and individuals to feed into technical development work that the institution will need to disseminate to everyone, as identifiers begin their creation the moment someone clicks "save" and names a file.

Approx. Funding Available:

Total amount of funding available: £70k 5 projects at £14k each

Approx Length of the Projects:

4 month projects
Eligibility to Bid

Proposals may be submitted by HE institutions funded via HEFCE, SFC, HEFCW and DEL Northern Ireland, and by FE institutions funded via SFC, DCELLS Wales and DEL Northern Ireland. FE institutions in England that teach HE to more than 400 FTEs are also eligible to bid provided proposals demonstrate how the work supports the HE in FE agenda.

Notes: Extra blurb General description: “Following a community consultation during 2010 Q1-2, a series of recommendations are being refined for investment in this area. This is likely to include case studies and sharing good practice in the use of identifiers on the web, and work with strategic partners (W3C, IDF) to inform this guidance and establish common ground.”

Value argument: “Identifiers are a key resource on the web; without a unique, readable and persistent identifier, a resource is not findable or useable. The benefit of this work is to enable HEIs to manage their identifier sets better, being better informed about how to do that and the risks of not doing it.”
