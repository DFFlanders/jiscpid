# Executive Summary #

The everyday use of identifiers in the form of "http://..." has become so commonplace, that most people take it for granted that it repreesnts the largest agreement between humans ever achieved.  The scale at which http identifiers are used the world over is an achievement only comparable to the worldwide postal address system,


therefore it is paramount that we dilengently oversee the use and patterns continually emerging around the use of identifiers, especially on behalf of the education sector who do not have the time our collective resources to monitor all .ac.uk domains or even the overall worldwide education sector (.edu, etc.).
