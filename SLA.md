# Service Level Agreement #

The following is a list of things that the Programme Manager is likely to consult upon for each project (please note: each individual programme manager has a different style of management and so please do pick up a phone or headset and call your programme manager before assuming anything):

  1. The general metaphor for 'what a programme manager does' can be surmised as a "lightning rod": existing in the HE/FE 'ether' so as to try and take advantage of the patterns across all the projects ('in the clouds') and bring their ideas down to earth so we can organise around the significant memes as a community (the other analogy is that of a "mutualistic communal organism", but that is not as cool as a "lightning rod" <zap!> ;-)
    * Programme managers are interested in WINS and FAILS equally, and of course there is "no penalty for learning" (personally I feel the 'fails' are often more valuable for the community than the 'wins').
    * _Help me help you_, by feeding back EARLY and OFTEN: please tell the world in real time when you solve a bug or inspire a user by posting short tweets or blog posts <-- if its not worth posting (even though it always is) the Cc field in your email is your best friend: NEVER hesitate to copy me in as it is the easiest way for you to communicate and keep me in the loop!
  1. Primarily _the job of the Programme Managers is to get know you_ and the "thing" (outputs) the project is producing, be that services, tools, code, reports or guides aka "project products".  Once the Programme Manager can effectively describe the project product they can help advertise your project to the wider world as well as help guide further funding initiatives!
    * As a pragmatic word of advice, the project should know that JISC has over ~200 hundred projects on the go at any one time, which usually means a programme manager only has about 120 characters to explain what your project is producing; so, helping you construct a brief synopsis of your project is essential in helping the programme manager in promoting the projects existence, e.g. think "Argos catalogue advert", a couple of sentences and a memorable image of your projects product can make or break a project.
    * And please don't just tell me about your project, think about the overall primary aim and audience of the project (which should be to the end user and community, NOT the JISC Executive).
  1. A Programme Manager must audit the accomplishments of the project via supporting documentation.  The most laborious part of the Programme Manager's job is keeping track of the documentation projects are _**required**_ to produce throughout the life of the project.  So please make sure to read over the ProjectDocumentationInstructions.
    * Deadlines for project documentation will be articulated well in advance of the due date and stated as part of the ProjectDocumentationInstructions on this wiki.
    * Communication on expected delivery of project documentation is required (if you are late with any documentation notice should be early and often!!!)
    * _Failure to actively communicate with the Programme Manager on documentation can result in stoppage and even pulling back of your funding._ <- please make my life easy by just staying in touch: blog & tweet & Cc & skype & blog & tweet & Cc & skype & blog & tweet & Cc & skype & blog & tweet & Cc & skype!!!
  1. A programme manager wants to help with the learning curve that is inherent in all innovation projects.  Even if you have been a project manager before or done development projects you will still need to see the project as an opportunity for learning so that you will be even more skilled next time around, i.e. make mistakes and make them fast!
    * Ideas for any training event for project managers, developers or user activities are much welcome and will be paid for by JISC if we decide to put on an event so start making suggestions for events!
  1. A programme manager primarily enjoys being there to help _support projects_ by providing advice on: development practices, IPR, evaluation techniques, dissemination plan and business case (sustainability) strategy.
    * Projects can be very lonely work at times and decisions are sometimes made without consulting community members outside of the inner project circle, your programme manager should be able to provide advice and more importantly connect you will people in the community who have been through it before! Don't be a victim to the "not built here" syndrome!
  1. Last but certainly not least is the essential service of helping create a community, which of course requires the 'wisdom of crowds' so we can find commonalities to jointly exploit!
    * Any ideas for how to enable shared commonalties between communities is greatly appreciated (and please do think outside of the JISC community box, there is a World Wild Web out there to utilise!).

# Chronological examples of service rendered by Programme Manager to individual projects #

From a typical project the following can be expected from the Programme Manager:
  * A face-to-face SiteVisit to the host project institution to meet and greet the project team (project manager, developers and bonus points if we can meet a real end user!).  This meeting will help establish the common themes accross all projects in the programme, so please do make sure to prepare as per the SiteVisit agenda.
  * A Programme Meeting with all projects in attendance
    * Guidance and knowledge sharing on what skills need to be developed as an effective project manager and innovation development team.
    * Getting you to know other projects <- projects do better when they find other projects to informally talk about things.
    * Having you meet 'critical friends' in the JISC community: devCSI community, UKOLN Support Centre, CETIS Support Centre, IPR Consultancy, Marketing and Advertisement support, etc.
    * You usually get a nice meal out of it, let alone the networking opportunities :)
  * Regular email updates on when Project Documentation is due
    * Feedback on how we can make documentation better for other community members enjoyment always appreciated.
  * Notifying you of any support projects or training events that might be applicable to the programme
    * e.g. developer community days, support team projects, evaluation and IPR workshops, etc.
  * Support for any project events of significance
    * Of particular interest are events that involve actual end users
    * Any multi-developer gathering: talkShop, barcamp, pair-programming, etc.
  * On call (twitter, skype, email, etc.) support on any queries.
    * Preference for asynchronous short messages if possible (e.g. twitter, skype, etc.)
    * Always glad to have a quick chat on the phone/skype (david.flanders), I usually try and work from home on Monday and Friday and welcome ad hoc calls on those days.
    * Please blog and tweet as much as possible, I'll follow you.  Or if not Web2 inclined please always have me in the Cc field!
  * Attendance at final project events
    * Meetings with senior management
    * Final evaluation lunches
    * Software launch events
  * Encouraging you to come along to community events,
    * e.g. the JISC conference, other relevant Programme meetings
  * Asking for your advice on other similar projects
    * Asking exemplary projects to mark the next round of bids for funding
    * Acquiring expert advice to advise or sit on JISC working groups
