# Final Sign Off Survey #
The reason for the 'Final Sign Off Survey' is three fold:
  1. opportunity for the project team to reflect with one another on what has been achieved and congratulate one another on a job well done.
  1. collect the 'soft' intangible products (skills, relationships, knowledge) that the project
  1. inform JISC how it can better run Programme and Projects in the future.
_N.B. It is worth noting that this survey replaces the 'final report' which was rather onerous on a single member of the team to produce, while this joint survey process can be more positive and interesting for the team's own benefits._


# Recommendation for How Conduct the 'Final Sign Off Survey' meeting #
The following suggestions are intended to help provide the "closing of a chapter" for the project, so that all project participants have an opportunity to reflect, feedback and celebrate the completion of the grant responsibilities.
  * Make this meeting informal, spend the last bits of budget on some wine, cheese, crackers, etc.
  * Schedule a late afternoon meeting so you can go to the pub afterwards to really celebrate.  Or take the survey with you to the pub and do it there.
  * Pause throughout the survey to encourage discussion and put down the main key points you talked about, regardless if they answer the question or not.  Let the conversation wonder as it reflects.
