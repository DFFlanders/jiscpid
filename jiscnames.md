# Project Overview #
  * **Full Name of Project**: Names 2 - Pilot National Name and Factual Authority Service 2
    * **Project Tag**: jiscNAMES
  * **Project Descriptions**
    * Long Description: The Names Project originally began in July 2007. It was funded to investigate requirements for a name authority service for UK repositories. A prototype name authority system has been developed as part of this work and a number of connections have been made with UK stakeholders and with international projects working in a similar space. The aim of this continuation to the first phase is to build upon the achievements of the Names Project by further developing the name authority prototype. This will extend the project for a further two years, building the prototype into a form that will be useful for repository services and working with new sources of information to improve the quality of the data.
  * **Problems it solves?**
    * For users of repositories of research outputs, it's important to be sure that all the materials submitted by an individual will be retrieved by a search on that person's name, without retrieving items that have been supplied by different people with similar or identical names
    * For individuals submitting their work, it's important to be able to easily assign their own identifier to their materials and to be able to unambiguously identify their institution and department
  * **Project Outputs/Products/Deliverables** (what thing are you producing?):
    * Reusable URIs for authors
    * Disambiguation algorithm
