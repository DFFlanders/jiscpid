# Project DoaP #
This is the Description of the "Linking You" project, uniquely tagged as "lncneu".

This aim of this project was to analyse and model the role of URIs in the overall 'learning landscape' of the university.  Like most other HEIs, Lincoln’s web presence has grown ‘organically’ over the years, utilising a range of authoring and content management technologies to satisfy long-term business requirements while meeting the short-term demands of staff and students. Licoln recognises the value of our .ac.uk domain as an integral part of our ‘Learning Landscape’ (a kind of virtual "real-estate" owned and maintained by the University) and, building on recent innovations in our Online Services Team, intend to re-evaluate the overall underlying architectural estate of our websites with a range of stakeholders and engage with others in the sector around the structure, persistence and use of the open data we publish on the Web. Some preliminary work has already been undertaken in this area and we wish to use this project to consolidate what we have learned as well as inform our own work through a series of wider consultations and engagement with the JISC community.
